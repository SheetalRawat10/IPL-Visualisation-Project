# IPL-Visualisation-Project
In this project, I created an interactive Tableau dashboard of IPL statistics for a newsletter, providing visual representations and customizable filters for enhanced user engagement.-
The IPL statistics dashboard will encompass three main categories:

1. Match Statistics:
Analyze toss outcomes versus match outcomes by ground/venue.
Highlight biggest wins by runs and wickets.
Record the highest totals across all seasons.

2. Player Statistics:
Showcase Orange Cap contenders (top run-scorers per season).
Identify Purple Cap contenders (top wicket-takers per season).
Track batsmen with the most fours and sixes (per season and overall).

3. Team Statistics:
Present season-wise team performance (wins vs. losses).
Calculate win percentages for home versus away matches.
